## It's 3AM. No Light, Just Night.

### Features

- Clean rounded style
- Consistent true black
- Minimal issues (Refer to the to-do list in the CSS file)
- Easy and simple customizability

- Privacy Blur

### Instructions

#### Vencord Installation

To install 3AM on Vencord:
1. Navigate to settings.
2. Go to themes.
3. Click on online themes.
4. Paste the following URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheesesamwich/3AM/main/3AM.css`


#### Other Client Installation

Currently, there is no documented support for any other modded Discord clients. The theme has been tested on Vencord, but it's expected to work fine elsewhere.

#### Privacy Blur Configuration

To enable privacy blur:
1. Download the theme locally to your Downloads folder.
2. Open it in your preferred IDE.
3. Modify the `--privacy-blur` variable to your liking in the CSS file.  
(Please be aware that this method is not ideal, and I currently don't recommend using this feature.)
