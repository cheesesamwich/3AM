## 3AM ðŸŒ™

Just a quick heads-up: The 3AM Plugin has been released, introducing custom fonts, server animations, and a privacy blurâ€”all configurable within the Discord app. This also means that the original 3AM theme and support for other modded clients will be depreceated. I'm shifting my focus from heavily documenting the code, to a simpler, user-friendly setup from within the plugin.

### Planned Or Potential Features

#### Ideas
- Transfer 3AM to a plugin for added support and customisability (eg: color and value config in app) (i'll definitely do this if i can, but vencord plugin docs are bleh so we'll see i guess)
- Darken and round spotify listen along invites
- Optimise the selectors to have a better update longevity
#### Bugs
- Adding comments to some class recolor lines
- Adjusting online status indicators that appear stretched (seemingly fixed, maybe?? I'm not sure, lol)
- Fixing the color of the Soundmoji experiment search button
- Maxwell's loading screen still sometimes shows keybind indicators

### Instructions

#### Vencord Installation

To install 3AM on Vencord:
1. Navigate to settings.
2. Go to themes.
3. Click on online themes.
4. Paste the following URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheesesamwich/3AM/main/3AM.css`

#### Other Client Installation

Currently, there is no documented support for any other modded Discord clients. The theme has been tested on Vencord, but it's expected to work fine elsewhere.
