## 3AM ðŸŒ™
### A chill rounded amoled plugin/theme for discord designed to remove all the clutter and flashiness of modern themes. Feel free to suggest or point out anything to me on discord!


### Features
- Consistent Amoled colors
- Minimal issues
- Built in custom fonts, animation toggling, and more.
- Full vencord toolbox integration
### Planned Or Potential Features
#### Ideas
- Making small adjustments to Spotify Listen Along invites for a cleaner look
- Improving selectors for more reliable updates

#### Bugs
- Adding comments to some class recolor lines
- Adjusting online status indicators that appear stretched (seemingly fixed, maybe?? I'm not sure, lol)
- Fixing the color of the Soundmoji experiment search button
- Maxwell's loading screen still sometimes shows keybind indicators

### Instructions
