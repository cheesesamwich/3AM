# 3AM
## It's 3AM. No Light, Just Night.

### Features

- Clean rounded style

- Easy and simple customizability
- Support for select Discord experiments
- Written with simplicity and understandability in mind

### Announcement: 3AM Plugin in Development

A 3AM Plugin is currently in development with exciting features, including:

- Custom font importing through plugin config
- Toggling the server and member list animation
- A new privacy blur feature that blurs potentially sensitive information (usernames, profile pictures, channel names) when not hovered on the client.
- And much more!

**Note:** With the release of the 3AM Plugin, the theme will be deprecated. The focus will shift from heavily documenting the code to providing a user-friendly UI for configuration within the plugin.

Stay tuned for updates! Meanwhile, here's a sneak peek:

### Planned Or Potential Features

#### Ideas
- Transfer 3AM to a plugin for added support and customizability (e.g., color and value config in-app)
- Darken and round Spotify Listen Along invites
- Optimize selectors for better update longevity

#### Bugs
- Hovering on a mention message causes it to turn yellow
- Missing comments on some class recolor lines
- Some online status indicators are vertically stretched
- Soundmoji experiment search button is the wrong color
- The custom Maxwell loading screen still displays keybind indicators
