### Planned Or Potential Features
#### Ideas
- Transfer 3AM to a plugin for added support and customisability (eg: color and value config in app) (i'll definitely do this if i can, but vencord plugin docs are bleh so we'll see i guess)
- Darken and round spotify listen along invites
- Optimise the selectors to have a better update longevity
#### Bugs
- Hovering on a mention message causes it to turn yellow
- Missing comments on some class recolor lines
- Some online status indicators are vertically stretched
- Soundmoji experiment search button is the wrong color
- The custom maxwell loading screen still displays keybind indicators

### Instructions

#### Vencord Installation

To install 3AM on Vencord:
1. Navigate to settings.
2. Go to themes.
3. Click on online themes.
4. Paste the following URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheesesamwich/3AM/main/3AM.css`

#### Other Client Installation

Currently, there is no documented support for any other modded Discord clients. The theme has been tested on Vencord, but it's expected to work fine elsewhere.
